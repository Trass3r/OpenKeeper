     * <p>
     * The first parameter defines how many bits are used to encode zone IDs.
     * Zones are always defined relative to the player so this will be a
     * function of the zone radius. For example, a radius of (1, 1, 1) means a
     * 3D grid that's 3x3x3 or 27 different zones. At least 5 bits would be
     * necessary to encode those IDs. I use 8 here arbitrarily to give some
     * space for zone radius experimentation. 8 bits should support a zone
     * radius up to (3, 3, 2).</p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The second parameter is how many bits are associated with the real object
     * IDs. These IDs are not sent with every message so it's important that the
     * value properly encompass all potential IDs. For example, using a long ID
     * from an ES you would need 64 bits. If game sessions are short lived and
     * your object IDs are only ever 'int' then 32 bits is the proper value.
     * This should usually be 64 bits and I'm keeping it as such... even though
     * this example could get away with 32 bits. Since these values are not sent
     * with every message and people might cut/paste these settings, I'm going
     * with the safer choice.</p>
