 * The Dungeon Keeper strings have some parameters which are shared between all
 * the strings. They all start with '%'. If '%' is wanted to be displayed, it is
 * entered twice: '%%'. The parameters are simple integer indexes. For example
 * '%37' -> index 37 (37 always means health).

 * could be one. But lets face it, our strings are very short.
