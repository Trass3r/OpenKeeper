# Effect Migration Notes

## Completed Migrations

1. **EffectManager**: Converted from plain Java class to AbstractAppState for better architecture integration
2. **TileData Dependency**: Removed by creating TerrainType enum and abstract IEffectContextProvider interface
3. **ModelViewer Tools**: All model viewer components now use new EffectManager
4. **PlayerMapViewState**: Successfully migrated to new EffectManager as AppState

## Remaining Commented Code Analysis

### MapController Effects (lines 525, 580, 589, 642, 647)
- **Location**: src/toniarts/openkeeper/game/controller/MapController.java
- **Purpose**: Visual feedback for terrain destruction/healing and room claiming
- **Issue**: MapController is a logic controller without visual dependencies
- **Proposed Solution**: Emit events that visual layer (PlayerMapViewState) can listen to

### Room Effect Comments in World Package
- **Location**: Various files in src/toniarts/openkeeper/world/room/
- **Status**: Left untouched per feedback - world package is deprecated and will be removed
- **Migration**: Effects should be handled by new room constructors or visual layer

## Architecture Benefits

- **Decoupled**: Effect system no longer depends on deprecated world types
- **Modern**: Uses AppState lifecycle management
- **Testable**: Clear interface abstraction for context providers
- **Compatible**: Deprecated system remains functional alongside new system

## Migration Strategy for Remaining Effects

1. Create event system for MapController to emit terrain change events
2. PlayerMapViewState listens to these events and triggers effects via EffectManager
3. World package effects remain commented until package removal
